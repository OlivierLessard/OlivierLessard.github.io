excerpt: "The increasing use of digital technologies and mobile-based registration procedures highlights the vital role of personal identity documents (IDs) in verifying users and safeguarding sensitive information. However the rise in counterfeit ID production poses a significant challenge necessitating the development of reliable and efficient automated verification methods. This paper introduces IDTrust a deep-learning framework for assessing the quality of IDs. IDTrust is a system that detects the quality of identity documents using a deep learning-based approach. This method eliminates relying on original document patterns for quality checks and pre-processing steps for alignment. As a result it offers significant improvements in terms of dataset applicability. Using a bandpass filtering-based method the system aims to detect and differentiate ID quality effectively. Comprehensive experiments on the MIDV-2020 and L3i-ID datasets identify optimal parameters significantly improving discrimination performance and effectively distinguishing between original and scanned ID documents."
